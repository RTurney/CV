## [Personal profile](#personal-profile):

Junior full stack developer with an interest in backend development. I have recently switched from a career in Biological sciences to software development with the aid of Makers 12-week bootcamp. This bootcamp has helped me advance from an interested self-taught amateur to a confident juniour developer. 

I am a driven and hardworking individual with a keen mind for problem solving. I believe I have excellent communication skills, both written and spoken, priding myself on my ability to help others understand complex or difficult concepts. I am always eager to expang my existing knowledge and skillset, either through self-led learning or courses. I am quick to grasp new concepts and apply them to my existing skillset. I am always happy to meet new people and enjoy working in a team. I believe I am a good team member, who is always ensuring that every team member feels included and part of the team's decisions. 

I am now currently looking for a role in London/Reading/Cambridge which will allow me to further consolidate and develop my programming knowledge, as well as gain exposure to current business practices.
